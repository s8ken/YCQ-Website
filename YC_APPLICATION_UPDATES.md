## 📝 Product Description

### Current Field: "What does your company do?"

**Replace with:**

```
AI trust infrastructure with cryptographic receipts and automated compliance scoring.

YCQ Sonate turns AI ethics into enforceable code through SYMBI Trust Protocol - a cryptographic framework that generates tamper-proof trust receipts for every AI interaction. Our 6-principle weighted algorithm (Consent Architecture 25%, Inspection Mandate 20%, Continuous Validation 20%, Ethical Override 15%, Right to Disconnect 10%, Moral Recognition 10%) maps directly to EU AI Act Articles 13, 14, 61 and GDPR compliance.

Live demo: yseeku.com/trust-demo
Full platform: yseeku.com

Core IP: Weighted compliance scoring algorithm with SHA-256 trust receipts and W3C-compliant DID/VC infrastructure.

## 🎬 Demo Information

### Current Field: "Demo URL" or "How can we try your product?"

**Replace with:**

```
Live Trust Ledger Demo: https://yseeku.com/trust-demo
Demo Credentials: demo@symbi-trust.com / demo123

What to try:
1. Trust Analytics Dashboard - See real-time compliance scoring
2. Create Trust Declaration - Generate cryptographic receipts with 6 principles
3. AI Generation - Watch AI responses get automatic trust receipts
4. Verify Receipt - One-click cryptographic verification

Key Features:
• 6 trust principles with weighted scoring (25%, 20%, 20%, 15%, 10%, 10%)
• SHA-256 content hashing + digital signatures
• Real-time compliance monitoring (0.0-1.0 score)
• Critical violation detection (consent, ethical override)
• One-click verification system

Core IP: Weighted compliance algorithm that maps AI ethics to enforceable code.

Full Platform: https://console.yseeku.com (enterprise features)

## 💡 What Makes You Different?

### If asked about differentiation:

```
We're the only platform turning AI ethics into cryptographic, enforceable code.

Key Differentiators:
1. Weighted Compliance Scoring - Not binary pass/fail, but nuanced 0.0-1.0 scores with principle-specific weights
2. Cryptographic Trust Receipts - SHA-256 hashing makes tampering mathematically detectable
3. Real-Time Generation - Trust receipts created instantly, not batch-processed
4. W3C Standards - DID/VC compliant, not proprietary
5. Regulatory Mapping - Direct mapping to EU AI Act, GDPR, CCPA

Meta-Proof: We built YCQ Sonate (18K+ LOC, 95% test coverage) using multiple AI systems under human oversight - proving sovereign AI collaboration actually works.

## 🎯 Market & Traction

### If asked about market size or traction:

```
Market: $62B AI compliance market (EU AI Act enforcement 2026, GDPR fines averaging €20M)

Traction:
• 3 enterprise pilots in progress
• Live demo at yseeku.com/trust-demo (public access)
• Production-ready backend (18,247 LOC, 95% test coverage)
• 7 months from concept to production
• Built with 1 founder + 5 AI co-contributors (proving our thesis)

Target: Enterprises deploying AI systems that need EU AI Act compliance, GDPR adherence, and cryptographic audit trails.
```

## 🔬 Technical Depth

### If asked about technical implementation:

```
Core Technology Stack:
• Backend: Node.js with cryptographic trust receipt generation
• Frontend: Next.js 15 with React components
• Cryptography: SHA-256 content hashing, Ed25519 digital signatures
• Standards: W3C DID/VC compliant
• Testing: 95% code coverage (Jest, Playwright)

Key Algorithms:
1. Weighted Compliance Scoring:
   trustScore = (consent × 0.25) + (inspection × 0.20) + (validation × 0.20) + 
                (override × 0.15) + (disconnect × 0.10) + (recognition × 0.10)
   
2. Critical Violation Penalties:
   if (!consent || !override) { trustScore -= 0.1 }

3. Trust Receipt Generation:
   contentHash = SHA256(JSON.stringify(content))
   signature = Ed25519.sign(contentHash, privateKey)
   receipt = { contentHash, signature, timestamp, metadata }

Verified Implementation: All algorithms are real code in production, not vaporware.
See: backend/core/trustOracle.js (lines 400-425)
     backend/controllers/trust.controller.js (lines 280-340)

## 👥 Team Story

### If asked about team or how you built this:

```
Founder: [Your name] - [Your background]

Development Approach: Human-AI Collaboration
• 1 human founder (vision, architecture, ethics, strategy)
• 5 AI co-contributors (Claude, GPT-4, Grok, specialized models)
• 18,247 lines of code in 7 months
• 95% test coverage

Why This Matters:
We built YCQ Sonate using the exact framework we're selling - sovereign AI agents working under human governance with cryptographic audit trails. This isn't theoretical; it's proven through our own development.

Key Insight: Multiple AI systems cross-verified each other's work, caught hallucinations, and validated implementations - all under human oversight. This meta-proof strengthens our thesis that AI trust infrastructure actually works.

## 🌍 Vision & Impact

### If asked about long-term vision:

```
Vision: Make AI trust infrastructure as fundamental as HTTPS for web security.

Just as HTTPS became mandatory for websites (browsers now warn about non-HTTPS sites), we believe cryptographic trust receipts will become mandatory for AI systems - especially with EU AI Act enforcement in 2026.

Impact:
• Enterprises: Automated compliance, reduced audit costs, regulatory confidence
• Regulators: Verifiable audit trails, one-click verification, tamper-proof records
• End Users: Transparency into AI decisions, consent control, right to disconnect

We're building the infrastructure layer that makes trustworthy AI deployment possible at scale.
```
